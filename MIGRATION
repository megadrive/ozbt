MIGRATION
---------

Version 2 of `ozbt` brings the eradication of MySQL (thank god) and the
introduction of ForerunnerDB, a really lovely NoSQL database. So, if anybody for
some reason used `ozbt` previously, please do the following:

```
First make sure your config files are up-to-date.

$ npm install
$ node migrationToForerunner.js
```

The script will install the new dependencies and then begin migrating tables
from your current MySQL database to Forerunner. Now, I'm bad at JavaScript and
can't for the life of me work out how to make it say "done!" when it's done so
when it stops doing stuff, unless you've got a looot of records, it'll be done
pretty quickly so just CTRL+C right outta the script and you'll be sorted.

I've kept mysql as a dependency for now, but give it a few weeks and it will be
removed from `package.json`. Believe you me, this is for the better. ForerunnerDB
gives me a lot more flexibility with how I can create modules and commands and
lets me, most of all, stay sane. I don't anticipate missing anything from MySQL
anyway. This just a silly little Twitch bot.

Do let me know if you run into any issues and I will get back to you as soon as
I can.

Toodles!
